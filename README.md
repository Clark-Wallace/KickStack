**An experimental AI-powered backend generator** that creates PostgreSQL schemas, REST APIs, and authentication from natural language. Built as an exploration of what's possible when combining AI with traditional backend tools.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Status: Experimental/Educational** - This project was an ambitious experiment in AI-driven development. While functional for prototypes and learning, it's not recommended for production use. Feel free to fork, learn from, or build upon it!

## What Is KickStack?

KickStack started as an attempt to create a "better Supabase" and pivoted to become an AI-first backend builder. It combines:
- ü§ñ Natural language to SQL schema generation
- üóÑÔ∏è PostgreSQL with PostgREST for instant REST APIs
- üîê JWT authentication with GoTrue
- üì¶ Docker Compose for local-first development
- ‚ö° Edge functions support
- üîÑ Realtime subscriptions via WebSockets

## The Journey & Lessons Learned

This project was an exploration that revealed important insights:

1. **The Vision**: Create a tool where you could describe your backend in plain English and get a complete, production-ready system
2. **The Reality**: The problem space is vastly more complex than anticipated
3. **The Learning**: AI can assist with schema generation, but the gap between "generated scaffold" and "production system" is massive

### What Works Well ‚úÖ
- Natural language to basic schema generation
- Local development environment setup
- PostgreSQL + PostgREST integration
- Template-based fallbacks when AI isn't available
- Basic CRUD API generation

### What's Missing for Production ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Complex business logic handling
- Migration safety and rollback strategies  
- Collaborative development workflows
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing
- API documentation generation
- Cost management for AI calls
- Production deployment patterns

## Quick Start (For Experimentation)

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Clark-Wallace/KickStack.git
cd kickstack
npm install

# Start the infrastructure
cd infra
docker-compose up -d

# Try the AI features (OpenAI API key optional)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..." # Optional - falls back to templates

# Generate a backend from natural language
npm run kickstack new "blog with posts and comments" --dry-run

# Create tables the traditional way
npm run kickstack add-table "users with name, email, role"
```

## Interesting Code to Explore

If you're learning or building something similar, check out:

1. **AI Plan Compiler** (`/ai/orchestrator/src/plan-compiler.ts`)
   - Converts natural language plans to SQL migrations
   - Generates TypeScript types from schemas
   - Creates React hooks automatically

2. **Policy Generators** (`/ai/cli/src/policies/`)
   - Row-level security patterns
   - Multi-tenancy with team scope
   - Owner-based access control

3. **Template System** (`/ai/cli/src/lib/template-manager.ts`)
   - Fallback when AI isn't available
   - Pre-built patterns for common apps

4. **Schema Evolution** (`/ai/orchestrator/src/manifest.ts`)
   - Tracks schema changes over time
   - Project state management

## Use Cases Where It Might Help

Despite its limitations, KickStack could be useful for:

- **Hackathons**: Get a backend running in minutes
- **Learning**: See how different backend pieces fit together
- **Prototypes**: Quickly test ideas without manual setup
- **Demos**: Generate example schemas for presentations

## If You Want to Fork This

Here's where you might take it:

### Option 1: Simplify Drastically
Remove the AI parts and focus on being a simpler, local-first Supabase alternative.

### Option 2: Focus on Learning
Turn it into an educational tool that explains backend concepts as it generates code.

### Option 3: Extract Components
The individual pieces might be useful:
- The CLI structure for database management
- The Docker Compose setup for local development
- The policy generators for RLS patterns
- The template system for scaffolding

### Option 4: AI Training Data
The patterns and templates could be useful for training more specialized AI models.

## Technologies Used

- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 with PostgREST
- **Authentication**: GoTrue (Supabase's auth service)
- **Storage**: MinIO (S3-compatible)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 (optional) with template fallbacks
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **CLI**: Commander.js with TypeScript
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose

## Why It's Not Production Ready

Being transparent about limitations:

1. **AI Unpredictability**: Natural language is ambiguous; generated schemas might not match intentions
2. **No Migration Safety**: No proper testing of migrations against existing data
3. **Limited Business Logic**: Only generates schemas, not complex workflows
4. **Missing Collaboration**: No team features, review processes, or change management
5. **Performance**: Generated queries aren't optimized; no smart indexing
6. **Documentation**: No automatic API docs or data dictionary generation
7. **Cost**: OpenAI API calls can get expensive quickly
8. **Testing**: Limited test coverage and no production battle-testing

- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for GPT-4 access

## Final Thoughts

KickStack was an ambitious experiment in pushing the boundaries of AI-assisted development. While it didn't achieve the dream of "natural language to production backend," it revealed important lessons about the complexity of real-world systems and the current limits of AI in software development.

Sometimes the best outcome of a project isn't a successful product, but the knowledge gained along the way. If you're thinking about building something similar, hopefully this code and these lessons save you some time.

**Remember**: Not every project needs to become a business. Sometimes building something ambitious and learning from it is success enough. üåü
